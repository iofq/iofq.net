        raised in the great lakes region, i'm passionate about all things linux & open source, privacy/anonymity, self-sufficiency, good eats, and the environment. I'm currently excited about the future of cryptocurrency; I'm hopeful that a society with less state control over work and trade will be more able to fairly distribute wealth amongst it's members. Internet-native value is created every day, and that value can only be distributed fairly with an internet-native currency.
        <p>
        crawl my github for dotfiles, containers, and bash, or send me a PGP encrypted email!
